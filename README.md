# Keeper-App

This is a simple keeper app project. 
In this app, user can add the notes and delete them. I have created the app with REACT JS.

## To run the project

- Enter to the directory where the file is downloaded
- install the node module dependencies in Hyper Terminal (HT) with "npm install"
- To run the app, in HT- npm start
